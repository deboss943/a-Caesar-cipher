# Caesar Cipher (Python)

A simple Python implementation of the **Caesar Cipher**, one of the classic encryption techniques. This program allows you to **encrypt** and **decrypt** messages by shifting letters in the alphabet by a fixed number.

---

## 📌 Features

* Encrypt and decrypt text
* Supports **uppercase and lowercase** letters
* Preserves **spaces, numbers, and symbols**
* Easy to understand and beginner‑friendly

---

## 🧠 How the Caesar Cipher Works

Each letter in the message is shifted forward (encryption) or backward (decryption) by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet.

Example with a shift of `3`:

* `A → D`
* `B → E`
* `X → A`

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.x installed on your system

### Installation

1. Clone this repository or copy the Python file.
2. Save the code as `caesar_cipher.py`.

---

## ▶️ Usage

Run the program from your terminal or command prompt:

```bash
python caesar_cipher.py
```

You will be prompted to:

1. Enter a message
2. Enter a shift value (number)
3. Choose encryption (`e`) or decryption (`d`)

---

## 🧪 Example

```
Enter your message: Hello World!
Enter shift value: 3
Type 'e' to encrypt or 'd' to decrypt: e
Encrypted message: Khoor Zruog!
```

## 🛠 Customization

You can:

* Modify the shift logic
* Import the `caesar_cipher` function into another Python project
* Extend it to include brute‑force cracking
